# Welding For Novices

For my first milestone project I have created an introduction to welding website. This is an informative site to provide helpful information. 
The website can be found here

## Who is this website for?

This is a website created to help people who are starting out in welding. It has been designed to provide information and useful tools to help anyone new to the practice that needs guidance on where to begin and if it is right for them. 
Who made this site?
I made this site as I have a background in welding and started out the same way by researching online to find out more. I wanted to create a site that I would have found helpful during the early stages of my interest in welding. 

## What does it do?

This site was designed to provide a gateway in to welding for a beginner without overwhelming them with too much information. It was created to be an informative site with links to equipment and a weekly newsletter to help someone new to this practice get a feel and understanding for it. To engage with the different types and to help them figure out which type of welding they want to go in to. 

## Features

### Navigation

The Logo can be found on the top left of the page which when clicked brings you to the landing page (About)
The other navigation links to the top right of the page are: About, Welding Equipment and Sign Up which link to the different sections.
The navigation colors were created to contrast with the background image but also to follow the theme of welding. 
The navigation clearly shows the logo and who the page is aimed at and the menu list makes the different sections of information easy to find. 

### The Home Section 

The About section gives an introduction to the site and its purpose. 
Outlines why the site is helpful and who it is for.
Provides information on the three main types of welding and the titles on the cards link to further information if the user wants to know more. 

### The Welding Equipment section

This section has an introduction that briefly explains why PPE (personal protective equipment) is important in welding.
There is also a brief explanation on choosing the right welding machine.
There are links in the titles to advise on the tools and to provide options on what has been rated the best, prices and what to buy.

### The Sign Up section

The Sign Up section has a brief introduction to explain the weekly newsletter.
There is a form to collect details, first name, last name, email and which type of welding.
The sign up form is valuable to the user as it gives them the option to sign up to the weekly newsletter. 

## UX 5 Planes

### Strategy Plane

The website was made to help people who were curious about welding or beginners to the practice with useful information about what welding is, why it can be a great career or hobbie and the best way to get started. The main objective is to provide a site that helps introduce welding in an informative way without overwhelming a beginner. 

### Scope Plane

Three different pages/sections: About, Welding Equipment and Sign up.
Pages to have clickable links to useful more in-depth information and equipment
Sign up form to a weekly newsletter
Social Media Links for more engagement. 

### Structure Plane

The website consists of three pages/sections which have a recurring header and footer on all pages.
Navigation and Footer

Both feature on every page to keep a consistent design and to help the user navigate through the pages needed and to have access to external content. 
Navigation consists of the logo on the right and the menu on the right with three sections: Home, Welding Equipment and Sign Up.
Footer consists of four social media icons that are links to the sites: Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram. 

#### Home Page

The home page consists of the navigation and footer along with an introduction to the site explaining what it is about. This leads in to three information cards at the bottom that provide information and clickable links for: MAG, MIG and TIG welding.

#### Welding Equipment Page

This page is providing useful links to the customer advising what equipment to buy or look in to as a beginner and some of the most recommended and reasonably priced. It briefly explains the need for PPE (personal protective equipment) and the draw backs with certain types of welding.

#### Sign Up Page

Features a brief explanation for the user about what they are signing up for. Explains what to expect in the weekly newsletter and has a sign up form for the user to enter their details and select which type of welding they are interested in. 

### Skeleton Plane

The wireframes were done on paper, please see the images below:

The design has been tweaked to be more responsive to mobile display and to allow the background image to be more visible behind the content. 

### Surface Plane

#### Fonts
I searched online to find which fonts compliment each other and would look good on the website, I used the link below:
https://www.creatopy.com/blog/google-font-pairings/
The two fonts I selected to use were 
Karla
Rubik
The font codes used were from Google fonts.

#### Colors

The color used for the logo and content background is #A44200 and rgba(164, 66, 0, 0.6) for opaque. – Rusty orange
The color used for the background if the image does not load is #001219 – Black pearl
The color used for the content text links and buttons is #e09f3e – Lighter orange
The color used for the general text and social media icons is #fff - white

I used https://coolors.co/ to help generate a palette for my website as I wanted very specific colors to follow the theme of welding. 

## Testing

The website has been tested on different browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox and IE. 
The website is responsive it functions on all screen sizes and the content adjusts as needed.
The website form has been tested and the fields that require entry have to be filled before it can progress.
I have asked others to review the content and can confirm it is all readable and accessible.

## Issues 
There has been issues with pictures fitting in to the display cards and being uniform. I used https://www.foto.fit/ to adjust the pictures into better sizes to fit in to the card containers.
My original navigation menu was not responsive to smaller screens so I changed it to a navigation bar that worked on smaller screens.
When looking for pictures for welding overalls, there were none available on any of the free photo stock sites so I had to use one of myself. 
Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were found when code was put through the official W3C validator.
CSS
No errors were found when code was put through the official Jigsaw validator.
Accessibility
I used Lighthouse to confirm my website was accessible and user friendly by having contrasting colors, an easy-to-read layout and the information order that made sense, please see below.
Deployment
I followed the steps below to deploy my website on GitHub:
Go in to Github repository and click on “Settings”
Find the “Source” section and select “Master Branch”
Once “Master Branch” has been selected, the website is now published with link provided.

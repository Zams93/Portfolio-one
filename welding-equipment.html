    <h3><strong>PPE(Personal Protective Equipment)</strong></h3> 

    <p id="ppe-about">PPE is the most important equipment to any welder, the truth is welding can be dangerous and not surprisingly as you are working with metals that reach melting point.
      However do not let this put you off because as long as you have the right protective gear there is nothing to worry about, 
      there is risk involved in anything you do but by investing in good quality PPE you highly reduce the chances and get to experience the fun side of welding whilst practicing good safety measures.</p>

    <h3><strong>Welders/Welding Machines</strong></h3>
    <p id="welding-machine-about">Picking the right welding machine is also key to producing a weld you're going to be proud of. 
      Expensive does not always mean the best and everyone has their own prefrences which you will also experience further down the line.
      It is also worth noting that depending on the type of welding you're doing you may need more than just the welding machine itself, 
      some people opt for MAG/Stick welders to begin with as they are the most portable and require less additional equipment to work.
      This is not to say you are limited to on MAG welding hence why we have provided other options in the links below.</p>
